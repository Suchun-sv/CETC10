Abstract = {{The recent advances in MEMS, embedded systems and wireless communication
   technologies are making the realization and deployment of networked
   wireless microsensors a tangible task. In this paper we study node
   localization, a component technology that would enhance the
   effectiveness and capabilities of this new class of networks. The n-hop
   multilateration primitive presented here, enables ad-hoc deployed sensor
   nodes to accurately estimate their locations by using known beacon
   locations that are several hops away and distance measurements to
   neighboring nodes. To prevent error accumulation in the network, node
   locations are computed by setting up and solving a global non-linear
   optimization problem. The solution is presented in two computation
   models, centralized and a fully distributed approximation of the
   centralized model. Our simulation results show that using the fully
   distributed model, resource constrained sensor nodes can collectively
   solve a large non-linear optimization problem that none of the nodes can
   solve individually. This approach results in significant savings in
   computation and communication, that allows fine-grained localization to
   run on a low cost sensor node we have developed.}},
